# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Hello, and welcome to "exherbo-leycec"! This is a third-party Exherbo
# repository maintaining exheres authored by leycec (i.e., Cecil Curry). Exheres
# are thought to work with leycec's current machine (i.e., the AMD64-armed Dell
# Zino), but should be treated with caution under other machines.
#
# --------------------( INSTALLATION                       )--------------------
# Install this Exherbo repository as you would any other: e.g., via
#
#     # Add an Exherbo repository configuration.
#     sudo cat > /etc/paludis/repositories/leycec.conf <<EOF
#       location = ${ROOT}/var/db/paludis/repositories/leycec
#       sync = git://github.com/leycec/exherbo-leycec.git
#       format = exheres
#     EOF
#
#     # Get this repository. (Note the "x-" prefix, below!)
#     paludis -s x-leycec
#
# If you receive errors, ensure that you've installed all repository masters
# (i.e., dependencies) required by this repository. Currently, these are the
# following repositories: "arbor" "java". You should already have "arbor".
# Install the remaining repositories as you would any other: e.g., via
#
#     # Add an Exherbo repository configuration for "java".
#     sudo cat > /etc/paludis/repositories/java.conf <<EOF
#       location = ${ROOT}/var/db/paludis/repositories/java
#       sync = git://git.exherbo.org/java.git
#       format = exheres
#     EOF
#
#     # Retrieve the contents of this repository. (Note the "x-" prefix, below!)
#     paludis -s x-java
# 
# If you still receive errors, please send me a comment. (...with my apologies.)
#
# --------------------( COMMENTS                           )--------------------
# Please send comments, patches, and patchy ululations to leycec at:
#
#     leycec {at} gmail {dot} com
#
# Or, alternately, as comment on leycec's wiki at:
#
#     http://raiazome.com/Exherbo
#
# --------------------( PATCHES                            )--------------------
# Please format patches like so:
#
#     # First, move the existing exheres being patched to a new revision. This
#     # ensures that repository users will be notified of your update.
#     #
#     # For example, suppose the exheres you are patching is named
#     # "fvwm-2.5.8.exheres-0". Then issue the following command to git:
#     git mv fvwm-2.5.8.exheres-0 fvwm-2.5.8-r1.exheres-0
#
#     # View your changes under Vim using "app-vim/exheres-syntax". There should
#     # be no highlighted lines: these indicate syntactical errors.
#     vim fvwm-2.5.8-r1.exheres-0
#
#     # Stage all changes to be committed with your patch.
#     git add fvwm-2.5.8-r1.exheres-0   # ...and whatever else
#
#     # Commit all changes. (The first line of your patch's commit message
#     # should be a sentence of not more than 60 characters; the next line
#     # should be blank; all other lines should describe the patch in greater
#     # detail, if necessary. Thanks!)
#     git commit
#
#     # Revise your commit if you find you've made a mistake. Git makes this a
#     # fairly painless process. After finishing all revisions, replace the
#     # most recent commit with a commit listing the revisions:
#     git commit --amend
#
#     # Produce a git patch suitable for sending via e-mail.
#     git format-patch origin
#
#     # Send it. Patches away! ;p
