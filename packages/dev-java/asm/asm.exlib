SUMMARY="Java framework enabling bytecode manipulation and analysis"
DESCRIPTION="
ASM is an all-purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework. It can
be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes, directly in
binary form. It provides common transformations and analysis algorithms allow to
easily assemble custom complex transformations and code analysis tools. ASM
offers similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but is focused on
simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and implemented to be
as small and as fast as possible, ASM is attractive for use in dynamic systems.
