SUMMARY="Java provider of common string encoders and decoders"
DESCRIPTION="
Commons Codec is Apache's Java provider of common string encoders and decoders
like base 64, hex, phonetic, and URLs. It was formed as an attempt to encourage
code reuse among various projects, providing an abstract framework for the
creation of encoders and decoders as well as functional utilities for working
with common encodings.
