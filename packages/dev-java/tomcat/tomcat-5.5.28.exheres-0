# Tomcat 5.5 ships a variety of "build.xml" files. The "${WORK}/build.xml"
# file delegates to "${WORK}/build/build.xml" with additional logic for
# retrieving online updates. That's bad. Thus, the latter is what we want.

ANT_SRC_PREPARE_PARAMS=( init )

# Tomcat's "build.xml" defines a "build" task building subcomponents for which
# we do not have the requisite dependencies. Don't run that. It also defines
# tasks building precisely the subcomponents we need. Run those instead.
ANT_SRC_COMPILE_PARAMS=( build-servletapi build-jspapi )

# The above tasks actually do too much: they compile, build javadoc, and build
# jar files. Most of these things are needed, anyway. So we're done.
