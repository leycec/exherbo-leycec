# Each major version of Apache Tomcat supports a different minor version of the
# 2.x series of the Java Servlet API. We don't particularly care which version,
# however; it's simply important we bump slots when bumping major versions
# supporting backwards-incompatible Java Servlet APIs. For details, see:

# Tomcat's "build.xml" is fairly buggy. Its "compile" task does not depend on
# its "build-prepare" task for example; thus, we explicitly run the latter.
# More disconcertingly, it explicitly depends on external jar files like
# Eclipse's JDT. But Eclipse itself depends on the Tomcat jar files. Thus, this
# introduces a catch-22. Patch her up, Sulu.
