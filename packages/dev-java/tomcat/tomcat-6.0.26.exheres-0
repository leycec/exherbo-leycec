# Each major version of Apache Tomcat supports a different minor version of the
# 2.x series of the Java Servlet API. We don't particularly care which version,
# however; it's simply important we bump slots when bumping major versions
# supporting backwards-incompatible Java Servlet APIs. For details, see:
