#FIXME leycec: this exheres does not provide a working Jetty server, at the
#moment. It merely provides jar files required by Eclipse. For example, see
#the following Gentoo overlay for sample files needed for a working server:
#    http://gentoo-overlays.zugaina.org/zugaina/portage/www-servers/jetty/files/
require jetty

PLATFORMS="~amd64 ~x86"

# Jetty 6.x.x is hosted by "codehaus.org", unlike Jetty 7.x.x. Unfortunately,
# like Jetty 7.x.x, Jetty 6.x.x is build via Maven rather than Ant. Exherbo has
# no working Maven exlib, at the moment; thus, temporarily resort to installing
# pre-compiled jar files.
#DOWNLOADS="http://dist.codehaus.org/${PN}/${PNV}/${PNV}-src.zip"
DOWNLOADS="http://dist.codehaus.org/${PN}/${PNV}/${PNV}.zip"

# Technically, this only applies to the most recent version of Jetty 6.x.x.
