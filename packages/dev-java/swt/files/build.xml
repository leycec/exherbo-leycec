     The "build.xml" bundled with Eclipse is Eclipse-specific, and in fact both
     assumes and requires Eclipse be already installed. This is an obvious
     problem for a source-based distribution, since the Eclipse exheres depends
     on the SWT exheres. (Ergo, the SWT exheres cannot itself depend on the
     Eclipse exheres.)

     To circumvent this circular dependency, the "build.xml" below entirely
     replaces the bundled "build.xml" with a vanilla Ant project performing
     only compilation and jarring.
