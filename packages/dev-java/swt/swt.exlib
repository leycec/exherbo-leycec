# SWT's "build.xml" is Eclipse-specific, and in fact both assumes and requires
# Eclipse be already installed. This is an obvious problem for source-based
# distributions, since the Eclipse exheres depends on the SWT exheres. (Ergo,
# the SWT exheres cannot itself depend on the Eclipse exheres.)
# 
# To circumvent this circular dependency, replace SWT's "build.xml" with a new
# "build.xml" just performing compilation and jaring.

SUMMARY="A GTK-based graphical widget toolkit for use with the Java platform."
DESCRIPTION="
SWT is a GTK-based graphical widget toolkit for use with the Java platform. It
was originally developed by IBM and is now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation
in tandem with the Eclipse IDE. It is an alternative to the AWT and Swing Java
GUI toolkits provided by Sun Microsystems as part of the J2SE Platform.
"

#FIXME: Define additional mirrors.

# Eclipse also bundles SWT source. That source, however, is 32-bit specific.
# Its "build.xml" file resides at "plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.${ARCH}/build.xml",
# and is tremendously more intricate than the fake "build.xml" created below.
# For example, it declares an Ant task resembling:
#
# <target name="replace.64.to.32" depends="init">
#    <echo>Converting java files to 32 bit in org.eclipse.swt project</echo>
#    <!-- Convert SWT 64 bit java source to 32 bit  -->
#    <replace dir="${plugindir}" includes="**/*.java" token="long /*int*/" value="int /*long*/" />
#    <antcall target="refresh" />
# </target>
#
# Nonetheless, our fake "build.xml" file seems to be sufficient. This suggests
# the Eclipse team over-engineered their SWT build process.
