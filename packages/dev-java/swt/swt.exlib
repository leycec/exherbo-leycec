SUMMARY="Eclipse is a multi-language integrated development environment (IDE)."

Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment comprising an
integrated development environment (IDE) and extensible plug-in system. It is
written primarily in Java and can be used to develop applications in Java and,
by means of plugins (occasionally written in other languages), such
languages as C, C++, COBOL, Python, Perl, PHP, et al. The IDE may be referred
to as Eclipse ADT for Ada, Eclipse CDT for C, Eclipse JDT for Java, and
