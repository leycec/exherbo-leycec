#FIXME leycec: Add a new "ant_tasks: jarjar" dependency to the
# "dev-java/apache-ant" exheres, for integrating with Ant.

# Jar Jar Links downloads to a file having this basename. (Set this prior to
# including the "googlecode" exlib to ensure that exlib establishes the proper
# ${DOWNLOADS} value.)

SUMMARY="Java utility for repackaging Java libraries"
DESCRIPTION="
Jar Jar Links is a Java utility for repackaging Java libraries to be
embedded into your Java library. This is useful for shipping a single jar file
having no external dependencies and for avoiding issues introduced by shipping
multiple jar files depending on specific versions of other libraries.
