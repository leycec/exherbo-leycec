SUMMARY="JavaCC generates Java source for parsing formal grammars"
DESCRIPTION="
JavaCC, the Java Compiler Compiler, is an open-source parser generator for the
Java programming language. It's similar to Yacc in that it generates a parser
for a formal grammar provided in EBNF notation, except the output is Java source
code. Unlike Yacc, however, JavaCC generates top-down parsers. This limits it to
the LL(k) class of grammars and, in particular, prevents use of left recursion.

#FIXME: Alas! Our resolvers don't support https fetching, yet, as that requires
#they support "fetch:" dependencies. As a VERY-VERY TEMPORARY FIX, I've agreed to
#host the distfile at a non-https URL. This is only temporary and should probably
#not be depended upon long-term! YMMV.
