SUMMARY="A framework for creating declarative matchers."
DESCRIPTION="
Hamcrest is a language-agnostic framework for creating matchers, allowing match
rules to be defined declaratively. These matchers have uses in unit testing
frameworks such as JUnit and jMock. (This is the Hamcrest Java port.)

# The "library" task in Hamcrest's "build.xml" compiles generator, core, and

# follows:
#
# * "hamcrest-generator-${PV}.jar". This is, as the name suggests, the Hamcrest
#   jar file responsible for generating the other two Hamcrest jar files. Since
#   it has no other utility, ignore it.
# * "hamcrest-core-${PV}.jar". This is, as the name suggests, the core Hamcrest
#   jar file. All exheres requiring Hamcrest require this jar file. Install it.
# * "hamcrest-library-${PV}.jar". Unhelpful name; this is a Hamcrest jar file
#   having supplementary Hamcrest matchers. Most exheres requiring Hamcrest do
#   not require this jar file. Nonetheless, install it.

# There is no "ANT_SRC_INSTALL_PARAMS" as this task both compiles and jars.
