SUMMARY="A framework for creating declarative matchers."
DESCRIPTION="
Hamcrest is a language-agnostic framework for creating matchers, allowing match
rules to be defined declaratively. These matchers have uses in unit testing
frameworks such as JUnit and jMock. (This is the Hamcrest Java port.)

# The "library" task in Hamcrest's "build.xml" compiles generator, core, and
# library class files and concocts three jar files archiving these files as
# follows:
#
# * "hamcrest-generator-${PV}.jar". This is, as the name suggests, the Hamcrest
#   jar file responsible for generating the other two Hamcrest jar files. Since
#   it has no other utility, we do not install it to the local system.
# * "hamcrest-core-${PV}.jar". This is, as the name suggests, the core Hamcrest
#   jar file. Most other exheres requiring Hamcrest require this jar file. Thus,
#   we install it.
# * "hamcrest-library-${PV}.jar". The name is not helpful; this is a Hamcrest
#   jar file having supplementary Hamcrest matchers. Most other exheres
#   requiring Hamcrest do not require this jar file. Nonetheless, we install it.
