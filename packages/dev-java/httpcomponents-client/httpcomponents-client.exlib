SUMMARY="Java provider of client-side HTTP connectivity and services"
DESCRIPTION="
Java Commons HttpClient implements client-side HTTP connectivity in an
efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich manner. It is designed for extensibility
while providing robust support for the base HTTP protocol, and should be of
interest to all Java projects building HTTP-aware client applications. Web
browsers, web service clients, and systems leveraging or extending the HTTP
protocol for distributed communication are good examples.
