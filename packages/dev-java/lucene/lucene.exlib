SUMMARY="Java text search engine library emphasizing high performance"
DESCRIPTION="
Java Lucene is a Java text search engine library emphasizing high performance.
It's suitable for applications requiring cross-platform portable, full-
featured, and full-text search.

#FIXME: Couldn't get SUBOPTIONS to work for the life of me; I suspect it
#requires physical modification to "arbor/profiles/options.conf". That would be
#rather unhelpful, if true. For the mexantime, we could use simple options. But
#that would require users explicitly enable:
#    "dev-java/lucene lucene_contribs_analyzers"
#as a dependency to building Eclipse, which is fairly lame. Thus, let's always
#make "analyzers" despite it being a *technically* optional library.

# Technically, Java Lucene does not require JavaCC to build: its source tarball
# already provides a pre-compiled parser generator to build itself against.
# Nevertheless, this exheres explicitely requires JavaCC to build, because:
#
# * Sun may pre-compile Lucene's parser generator against now-deprecated
#   versions of JavaCC. Lucene 3.0.1 shipped with a parser generator compiled
#   against JavaCC 4.1, for example, when JavaCC's current version was 5.0.
# * Because, given a choice between accepting pre-compiled binaries and self-
#   compiling system-specific binaries, Exherbons choose the latter. Hu-ah!

# Lucene requires "javacc.jar" to run the "javacc" task, which makes sense.
# But it requires it under "/usr/share/javacc/bin/lib/", which doesn't. We
# don't really feel like patching its "common-build.xml" file, however, so we'll
# grudgingly accept that by setting "-Djavacc.home" to "/usr/share/javacc";
# Lucene's "common-build.xml" will do the rest and pull the jar from there.
#
# Lucene often appends "-dev" to version strings, which produces jar files
# resembling "${PN}-core-${PV}-dev.jar", which is not a recognizable
# version suffix, which produces pain elsewhere. Work around by explicitly
# setting the Ant "version" parameter.
