# ICU4J comes bundled with two supplementary jar files needed for building:
# "icudata.jar" and "testdata.jar". They contain .res files rather than
# .class files; these files provide internationalization resources, and must
# not be purged! Note that they need not be installed to the local system,
# however, as the build process automatically adds their content to the output
# ICU4J jar file.

SUMMARY="Java library providing Unicode and globalization support"
DESCRIPTION="
ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode
and globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable and
gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java
software. (This is the Java port.)
